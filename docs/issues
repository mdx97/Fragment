Auth
- Need better fallback mechanisms for failed API calls and credential failures.

Session controller
- Issue with polling the current song when there isn't an active device, throws an error.
- When the queue is replenished when the last song of the queue is playing, it skips the last song in the queue.
- Need a way to replenish the uri cache in case it runs out of tracks.
- Need to verify user inputted playlist names.
- Refactor so that a class isn't needed for the controller functions. We will just store state in module global vars.
